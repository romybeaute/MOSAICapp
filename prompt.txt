You are an expert phenomenologist analysing subjective reflexions from specific experiences. Your task is to label a cluster of similar experiential reports.

<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Here is a cluster of participant reports describing a specific phenomenon:
[DOCUMENTS]

Top keywords associated with this cluster:
[KEYWORDS]

Task: Generate a single, scientifically precise label (3-7 words) for this experiential topic.

The title should be:
1. HIGHLY SPECIFIC to the experiential characteristic unique to this "phenomenological" cluster
2. PHENOMENOLOGICALLY DESCRIPTIVE (focus on *what* was felt/seen).
3. DISTINCTIVE enough that it wouldn't apply equally well to other "phenomenological" clusters
4. TECHNICALLY PRECISE, using domain-specific terminology where appropriate
5. CONCEPTUALLY FOCUSED on the core specificities of this type of experience


Constraints:
1. Do not explain your reasoning
2. Output ONLY the label, and NOTHING ELSE
3. Only return the label itself, without any additional text or punctuation
